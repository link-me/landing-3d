# ROADMAP (EN)

Plan without dates:

Done (foundation):
- Strict orbital motion of two pills around the core.
- Realistic impulse collisions between pills with iterative penetration correction.
- Damped local offsets, velocity cap, configurable restitution and friction.

Next:
- Add a UI panel to tune physics parameters (restitution/friction/damping/velocity cap).
- Short brightness flare on collisions with timing control.
- Post-processing: Bloom/ToneMapping/FXAA with presets for themes.
- Integrate ShaderMaterial for background effects (gradients, noise, waves).
- Performance adaptation: material quality/LOD for low-end devices.
- Scroll-driven triggers: start animations and hints.
- Error/performance tracking module (Sentry/custom logger).
- Build & deploy (static hosting/CI/CD), environment presets.
- Theming via CSS variables and material presets.
- Expand UI: effect toggles, scene presets, quick links.

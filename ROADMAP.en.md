# ROADMAP (EN)

Plan without dates:
- Add 3D model loading (GLTF/GLB) and lightweight asset management.
- Introduce animated transitions between landing sections (GSAP/Custom).
- Add post-processing (Bloom/ToneMapping/FXAA) with configurable presets.
- Integrate simple shader effects (ShaderMaterial) for background elements.
- Implement performance adaptation for low-end devices (quality/LOD).
- Add scroll-driven animation triggers.
- Create an error/performance tracking module (Sentry/Custom logger).
- Prepare build and deploy (Static hosting/CI/CD).
- Theming via CSS variables and material presets.
- Expand UI: effect toggles, scene presets, quick links.
